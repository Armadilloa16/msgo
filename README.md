I am planning on starting by having a go at porting MALDIquantForeign (https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquantForeign) into go 
and see how i go from there.

For the time being this is mostly a learning exercise for me, learning/ practicing both golang and software engineering ideas.

Ideally it would be good to have a transparent, organised, maintainable, and documented suite of tools. Admittadly there
exist other attempts at this out there, such as https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant for example, and I might just end up 
having a go at contributing to them instead, but this is where I thought I would start. Not sure how long I'll make it before
giving up on the idea. We'll see. Worst case scenario I expect to learn alot. :P
